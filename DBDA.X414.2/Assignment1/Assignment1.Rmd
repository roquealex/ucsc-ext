```



**1.What is machine learning? What is the difference between data mining and machine learning? (2 points)**

**2. What is supervised and unsupervised learning? Give examples and applications where each can be used (2 points)**

**3.What is normalization and why do you perform? Explain with examples. What are the different techniques used? (2 points)**

**4.What does K stand in K-nearest neighbor algorithm? How do you determine the optimal value of K. Take Wisconsin cancer data (provided), determine the optimal
value of K. Plot misclassification error for test as well as training data. ( 4 points)**

```{r code0}
x <- c(0:10)
y<-x*x
y
yp <- vector()
for(i in 1:length(x)){
  yp[i] <- x[i]*x[i]
}
yp

ypp <- sapply(x,function(a){a*a})
ypp

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
