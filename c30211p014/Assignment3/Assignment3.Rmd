## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


ASSIGNMENT # 3

In this homework, you will do some data analysis using R for the Forest Fire Data described http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/forest-fires/forestfires.csv

The dataset is used to find the relationship between the burned area of forest fires and meteorological data.

1. Import the data into R.
a. How many observations are there in the
dataset?
b. How many observations are there with a fire
(i.e., area>0)
c. How many observations are there with a rain
(i.e., rain>0)
d. How many observations are there with both a
fire and a rain?
2. Show the columns month, day, area of the all the observations.
3. Show the columns month, day, area of the observations with a fire
4. How large are the five largest fires (i.e., having largest area)
a. What are the corresponding month, temp, RH, wind, rain area?
b. Reorder factor levels of month to be from Jan to Dec. Add one column to the data indicating whether a fire occurred for each observation (True for area >0 and False for area ==0)
