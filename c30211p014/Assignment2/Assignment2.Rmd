```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting 

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

**1. Create two matrices from the given set of numbers
X1 = {2,3,7,1,6,2,3,5,1} and x2 = {3,2,9,0,7,8,5,8,2}**

```{r matrix_declaration}
x1 <- matrix(c(2,3,7,1,6,2,3,5,1),nrow=3)
x2 <- matrix(c(3,2,9,0,7,8,5,8,2),nrow=3)
x1
x2
```

**2. Find the matrix product.**
```{r matrix_prod}
prod <- x1 %*% x2
prod1 <- x2 %*% x1
prod
prod1
```

**3. Find the inverse of the matrix and prove that it
is correct.**

Inverse:
```{r matrix_inv}
inv <- solve(prod)
inv
```

Proof: On an nxn matrix A  multiplication of $AA^{-1} = I_n$
```{r matrix_inv_proof}
proof <- prod %*% inv
proof
```

There are some non zero numbers outside of the diagonal but they are too small.
```{r check_for_zero}
treshold <- 1.0e-15
test_z <- proof - diag(nrow(proof))
max_num <- max(abs(test_z))
if (max_num < treshold) {
  print("PASS: It is an identity matrix")
} else {
  print("FAIL: It is not an identity matrix")
}
```

**4. Load the Animals data set from the “MASS”
package**


**5. Find the correlation coefficient of brain and
body in this data set and comment on the
relation between them**

**6. Load USArrests data set. Comment on the
distribution of the variables. Is there any
relation between UrbanPop and three crimes**

**7. Which states has most and least assault,
murder, and rape arrests.**

**8. List the states which have assault arrests more
than median of the country.**

**9. Which states are in the bottom 25% of
murder**

**10. Which states are in the top 25% of the murder.**
